## Deployment Strategy

### Step 1: Core Deployment
```bash
# Deploy core canisters in order
dfx deploy lnft_core    # Hub for all operations
dfx deploy auth         # Authentication system
dfx deploy cronolink    # Neural interface
```

### Step 2: System Integration
```bash
# Deploy supporting systems
dfx deploy memory_system
dfx deploy traits
```

### Step 3: Frontend Deployment
```bash
# Build and deploy frontend
cd src/frontend
npm install
npm run build
dfx deploy frontend
```
